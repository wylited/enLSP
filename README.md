# enLSP

## Description
An english language server protocol aimed at autocompletion, grammar, syntax highlighting and more

## Installation

To get this LSP working (at whatever the current stage is) you need to install the following dependencies:
- Cargo

### dependencies:

Debian based:
```
sudo apt install cargo
```

Arch based:
```
sudo pacman -S cargo 
```

Fedora based:
```bash
sudo dnf install cargo
```

### install:

after having that dependencies installed, you can install the LSP by running the following command:
```bash
cargo install enlsp (currently not viable btw, please build from source)
```
or build from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wylited/enLSP.git
cd enlsp
cargo build --release
``` 
or debug mode with `cargo build --debug` or just `cargo build`

(currently the built binary will be found in the `target/debug` folder or `target/release` folder)

## Configuration
some configuration file will be made later and an explanation of how to configure it will be described.
